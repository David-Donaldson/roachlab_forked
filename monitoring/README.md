# What are we deploying?
- [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf): Telegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics. Based on a plugin system to enable developers in the community to easily add support for additional metric collection.
- [InfluxDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb): InfluxDB is a time series database built from the ground up to handle high write and query loads. InfluxDB is meant to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts of timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.
- [Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana): Query, visualize, alert on, and understand your data no matter where itâ€™s stored. With Grafana you can create, explore, and share all of your data through beautiful, flexible dashboards.
- [Prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus): Prometheus is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.
