# roachlab
An ongoing project to create a secure and modular environment to host various services I find useful. Each different aspect of the server is meant to be deployed on its own virtual machine unless specified within the tutorials. These tutorials are aimed towards Proxmox users but most of the services and steps followed can be used on any platform-bare metal or otherwise.
## Contents
- [MANAGEMENT](/management): A project to make monitoring your self-hosted services and the servers hosting them simple and easy. WIP.
- [NETWORKING](/networking): A project to make managing various aspects of your HomeLab's network simple and painless. 
- [HTPC](htpc/): A project to make self-hosting your entire home theater stack as simple as running one command (right now it takes a few though!).
